# Do all of this in a .py file in Pycharm
# Create a variable and assign it the string "Just do it!"
# Access the "!" from the variable by index and print() it
# Print the slice "do" from the variable
# Get and print the slice "it!" from the variable
# Print the slice "Just" from the variable
# Get the string slice "do it!" from the variable and concatenate it with the string "Don't ".  Print the resulting string, which should be "Don't do it!" where the "do it!" part is a slice.

# Section 1

# hater = "Don't"
# nike = "Just do it!"
# print(nike[10])
# print (hater,nike[5:])



# Create a variable and assign it a float
# Use print() and type() to print the data type of the variable in the output
# Use str() on the variable from step 1 and concatenate it with the string " is a float." then use print() to display the result
# print() the string "Hello, I'm [name], it's nice to meet you!" including quotes (you will need to use the \' or \" escape sequence depending on whether you enclose your strings in single quotes or double quotes.)

# SECTION 2

# useLess = "is a float"
# gas = str(2.78) #todo 1
# print (type(gas), 'very useless too') #todo 2
# print (gas, useLess) #todo 3
# print ("\"Hello, Im Jayoptic, its nice to meet you!\"") #todo 4

# SECTION 3
print ("*******\n *****\n  ***\n   *") #Like what is this bro... highly doubt in real world you'll use this
